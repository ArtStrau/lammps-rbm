# lammps-rbm



This repository analyzes **fully overdamped rotational Brownian motion (RBM)** in LAMMPS.



It includes:

* LAMMPS input scripts that generate angle time series with the existing integrator and with an **improved geometric integrator** proposed as a future LAMMPS extension, following our work (see Reference).
* Python/Jupyter scripts to clean raw output and reconstruct probability distributions.
* Comparison of numerical distributions with **analytic results** from the reference.

The initial focus is on **spherical particles**.
