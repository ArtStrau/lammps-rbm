\# lammps-rbm



This repository analyzes \*\*fully overdamped rotational Brownian motion (RBM)\*\* in LAMMPS.



It includes:



\- LAMMPS input scripts that generate angle time series with the existing integrator and with an  

&nbsp; \*\*improved geometric integrator\*\* proposed as a future LAMMPS extension, following our work (see Reference).  

\- Python/Jupyter scripts to clean raw output and reconstruct probability distributions.  

\- Comparison of numerical distributions with \*\*analytic results\*\* from the reference.
